# RES-AH-0005 - Cross Chain Pickle Distributions
## Description
- 50% of the Polygon rewards to be moved to Arbitrum, resulting in the following cross-chain rewards distribution.
  - Ethereum Mainnet: 2/3rds of $PICKLE rewards
  - Arbitrum: 1/6th of $PICKLE rewards
  - Polygon: 1/6th of $PICKLE rewards
- Rewards are to be distributed evenly within Arbitrum farms. Moreover, a redistribution of farm allocations within Polygon should be discussed imminently as many farms there have stopped making economic sense.
