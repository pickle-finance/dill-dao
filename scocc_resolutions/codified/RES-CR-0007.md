# Pickle Code Title 300 - Marketing Guidelines

## Abstract
The purpose of this document is to provide general goals for marketing to strive for.

## New Jar
- Announcement on Discord
- Tweet to target demographic in target language.
- Contact protocol jar is for to see if we can collaborate (prior to release).
- Discord brigading

## New Liquidity Protocol
- Everything for new jar
- See if can do an AMA on the protocol's discord
- Multiple tweets throughout the week, building up hype both before and after launch.

## New Chain
- Everything above plus
- Medium article before and after release
- Teaser tweets in the weeks leading up
-  NFT giveaways
-  launch party with raining Pickle tip bot
-  Well planned release, work must be done prior to teasing before launching at target demographic's prime time at a planned time.
-  Advertisement immediately following launch

## Strategy Migration
- When discovery of  the need for migration occurs, tweet and announce in discord when and how users will be impacted (Do nothing we got you covered!).
- Day before migration tweet and announce again that we have you covered.
- After migration is complete, announce successful migration in discord and tweet.

## A hack in Defi in general
- (If effects Pickle) Tweet/announce in discord when assessment is under way (asking for patience).
- Tweet and announce on discord funds are safe/lost and plan of action.

## Critical Situation in Pickle
- Announce at time of discovery of the issue on twitter and discord, asking for patience.
- Routinely update users on status.
- On resolution inform users.
- Create a medium article chronicling all the findings, details, and updates.
