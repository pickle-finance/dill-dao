## Appendix
``` 
Every core contributor shall be entitled to paid annual leave (also known as “paid time off”) consisting of
- paid vacation days: 20 (4 weeks assuming 5-day workweek) per year
- paid public holidays: per statute in contributor’s country of residence or federal holidays in USA

With the following conditions:
- 1st year paid vacation days are earned "pro-rata" with no paid vacation days earned during the contributor’s probation period (first 3 months)
- paid vacation days can be accumulated, rolled-over, or carried-forward, but only up to a maximum of 30 days in the "leave bank" at any given time
- every year, a maximum of 10 days of leave can be encashed, at half-rate
- in case of termination, days accumulated in the "leave bank" will be encashed as part of the terminal payment, at full rate.
- taking paid vacation days will require authorisation by supervisor and notification to SCCOC.

A note on “extended leave”:
- extended leave is considered leave beyond what's accumulated in the "leave bank", which can be granted under exceptional circumstances to contributors providing a valid reason to be interpreted by the SCCOC, at half-rate.
