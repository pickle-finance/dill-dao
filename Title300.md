# Pickle Code Title 300 - Marketing Guidelines

## Abstract
The purpose of this document is to provide general goals for marketing to strive for.

## New Jar
- Announcement on Discord
- Explainer what the Jar does (copy for docs, possibly frontend in similar fashion to PBAMM).
- Infographic on explainer
- Tweet to target demographic in target language, tag the partner, include APY at launch, highlight benefits.
- Contact protocol jar to see if we can collaborate (prior to release).
- Schedule "flash AMA" for launch on Discord of target audience, otherwise raid it.
- Whether flash AMA or raid, army of hecklin' shillin' Green Berets (i.e. battle-hardened Picklers) will accompany the launch to hype it up as well as guide the new users and collect feedback to improve both launch playbook and UX/UI


## New Liquidity Protocol
- Everything for new jar
- See if can do an AMA on the protocol's discord
- Multiple tweets throughout the week, building up hype both before and after launch.

## New Chain
- Everything above plus
- Medium article before and after release
- Teaser tweets in the weeks leading up
-  NFT giveaways
-  launch party with raining Pickle tip bot
-  Well planned release, work must be done prior to teasing before launching at target demographic's prime time at a planned time.
-  Advertisement immediately following launch

## Strategy Migration
- When discovery of  the need for migration occurs, tweet and announce in discord when and how users will be impacted (Do nothing we got you covered!).
- Day before migration tweet and announce again that we have you covered.
- After migration is complete, announce successful migration in discord and tweet.

## A hack in Defi in general
- (If effects Pickle) Tweet/announce in discord when assessment is under way (asking for patience).
- Tweet and announce on discord funds are safe/lost and plan of action.

## Critical Situation in Pickle
- Announce at time of discovery of the issue on twitter and discord, asking for patience.
- Routinely update users on status.
- On resolution inform users.
- Create a medium article chronicling all the findings, details, and updates.

## Regular Updates
  - (Weekly) State of the Jars: fastest-growing in TVL, best performing in APR/APY, "Pickler's choice"
  - (Weekly) a jar in focus: highlight a strategy that the Team / SCCOC / Community feels is strategic or puts people in a good light, basically re-publish the infographic with some new cover/card art and copy, this helps SEO and conditions the audience.
  - (monthly) pre - Community Call hype: hint milestones achieved, most profitable jars, discussions in community, highlight benefits of DILL, invite to lock PICKLE / join DILL DAO / join call.

## Misc Events
- Double-down on any jar that grows TVL >7% WoW or >30% MoM (highlight, promo, re-raiding/AMA)
- Highlight any jar where APY shoots up 
- Pounce on things in the news cycle / Crypto Twitter and re-purpose them to how they relate to Pickle and how users benefit now or will be benefiting soon (e.g. Treasury/Governance discussions, upcoming network upgrades / launches, state of DeFi, DAOs vs the world, Bear/Bull debates, etc)
